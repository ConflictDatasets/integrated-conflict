abstract = {Matching is a procedure aimed at reducing the impact of observational data bias in causal analysis. Designing matching methods for spatial data reflecting static spatial or dynamic spatio-temporal processes is complex because of the effects of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. Both may be compounded with temporal lag in the dependency effects on the study units. Current matching techniques based on similarity indexes and pairing strategies need to be extended with optimal spatial matching procedures. Here, we propose a decision framework to support analysts through the choice of existing matching methods and anticipate the development of specialized matching methods for spatial data. This framework thus enables to identify knowledge gaps.},

@article{Christiansen2022,
abstract = {How does armed conflict influence tropical forest loss? For Colombia, both enhancing and reducing effect estimates have been reported. However, a lack of causal methodology has prevented establishing clear causal links between these two variables. In this work, we propose a class of causal models for spatio-temporal stochastic processes which allows us to formally define and quantify the causal effect of a vector of covariates X on a real-valued response Y. We introduce a procedure for estimating causal effects and a nonparametric hypothesis test for these effects being zero. Our application is based on geospatial information on conflict events and remote-sensing-based data on forest loss between 2000 and 2018 in Colombia. Across the entire country, we estimate the effect to be slightly negative (conflict reduces forest loss) but insignificant (P = 0.578), while at the provincial level, we find both positive effects (e.g., La Guajira, P = 0.047) and negative effects (e.g., Magdalena, P = 0.004). The proposed methods do not make strong distributional assumptions, and allow for arbitrarily many latent confounders, given that these confounders do not vary across time. Our theoretical findings are supported by simulations, and code is available online.},

In recent years, much progress in causal inference has been made in statistics, economics, epidemiology and computer sciences, but limited progress has been made in spatial statistics due to the nonrandom, nonrepeatability and synchronism of spatial data. In this paper, we investigate the problem. We first refine the issues of causal inference, then discuss the causal inference issue in spatial statistics, next review the causal inference methods in other disciplines and analyze their potential to be used with cross-sectional data, and finally we look forward prospect of causal inference in spatial statistics.},

@article{Reich2021,
abstract = {The scientific rigor and computational methods of causal inference have had great impacts on many disciplines but have only recently begun to take hold in spatial applications. Spatial causal inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.},

@article{Ball2019,
abstract = {What role can statistics play in assessing the patterns of lethal violence in conflict? This article highlights the evolution of statistical applications in assessing lethal violence, from the presentation of data in the Nuremberg trials to current questions around machine learning and training data. We present examples from work conducted by our organization, the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, and others, primarily researching killings in the context of civil wars and international conflict. The primary challenge we encounter in this work is the question of whether observed patterns of violence represent the true underlying pattern or are a reflection of reports of violence, which are subject to many sources of bias. This is where we find the foundations of twentieth-century statistics to be most important: Is this sample representative? What methods are best suited to reduce the bias in nonprobability samples? These questions lead us to the approaches presented here: multiple systems estimation, surveys, complete data, and the question of bias within training data for machine learning models. We close with memories of Steve Fienberg's influence on these questions and on us personally. "It's all inference," he told us, and that insight informs our concerns about bias in data used to create historical memory and advance justice in the wake of mass violence. 63},

@article{Papadogeorgou2020,
abstract = {Many causal processes have spatial and temporal dimensions. Yet the classic causal inference framework is not directly applicable when the treatment and outcome variables are generated by spatio-temporal processes with an infinite number of possible event locations. We extend the potential outcomes framework to these settings by formulating the treatment point process as a stochastic intervention. Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events in a specified area under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. We develop methodology that allows for arbitrary patterns of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. Using martingale theory, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods increases, even when the propensity score is estimated. We propose a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unmeasured confounders, and extend it to the H\'ajek estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the estimators' finite sample performance. Finally, we use the proposed methods to estimate the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. We find that increasing the average number of daily airstrikes for up to one month results in more insurgent attacks across Iraq and within Baghdad. We also find evidence that airstrikes can displace attacks from Baghdad to new locations up to 400 kilometers away.},

abstract = {To provide an unbiased estimate, a regression analysis depends, among other things, on there being no unmeasured confounding. Often, unmeasured confounding is thought to be possible, but not severe; leading to a secondary instrumental variables (IV) analysis. However, these two analyses are correlated. It is unclear how much independent evidence is provided by the IV analysis. We resolve this redundancy using a new estimator, which extracts the part of the regression estimator uncorrelated to the IV-based 2SLS estimator. We apply our approach to analyze the effect of exposure to violent conflict on preferences for altruistic behavior, time and risk.},

@article{Mulatu2017,
abstract = {[Ethiopia's administrative regions have gone through a major transformation in the last century. Prior to 1974, Ethiopia's administrative units were defined based on administrative efficiency, capacity to collect taxes and loyalty and the ability of governors to raise militia forces. Following the 1974 revolution, ethnic politics began to play a major role in the Ethiopian political discourse, and with the rise to power of the EPRDF, ethnic politics held a central role in reorganizing administrative units and in defining citizenship. This paper traces the evolution of administrative units in Ethiopia with a focus on the work done by the Institute for the Study of Ethiopian Nationalities under the Derg. It highlights the danger of using ethnic politics in defining the structure of administrative units and concludes by outlining major principles worth considering in formulating territorial administrative structures that are conducive to economic development, cultural diversity, and democratic participation for all.},

Making use of unexpected attacks by the extremist group Boko Haram in Nigeria, which occurred during the fieldwork of a public opinion survey in 2014, we show that even in a context of weak state institutions and frequent terrorist activities, terror attacks significantly increase political trust. We also find that the attacks significantly reduced the salience of respondents' national identity, instead increasing ethnic identification. These findings run counter to arguments that “rally around the flag” effects following terror attacks result from increased patriotism. The results have important implications for understanding the effects of terrorism in contexts of weak state institutions, frequent political violence, and politically salient ethnic divisions.},

@article{Cools2020,
abstract = {Global climate change makes extreme precipitation events likely to become more frequent and intense in large parts of Africa. We study the effect of rainfall shocks on intimate partner violence in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis shows the presence of spatial autocorrelation in rainfall shocks, which compromises the exogeneity of rainfall shocks in many applications. We correct for the autocorrelation using spatial polynomials. In particular, we use three different estimation strategies. We first use the complete cross-sectional sample to analyze whether recent droughts are correlated with respondents' experience with intimate partner violence during the last year. We then use the nine countries with repeated surveys to construct a repeated cross-section analysis at the grid level. Finally, we use event history analysis on a time series constructed from the information provided by the abused women about when the violence first took place. We find no robust evidence that droughts increase intimate partner violence. Potential explanations are that the rainfall shocks do not affect spouses' power, or that the slow onset of the droughts allows for a calmer response to the crisis. We contribute to the wider literature on climate and conflict as many of the mechanisms, economic and psychological, that link climate to violence apply to both intimate partner violence and organized violence.},

@article{Siroky2015,
abstract = {Objective: The literature on indiscriminate violence has emphasized how information shapes state capacity and determines whether and where the government employs collective targeting. This article investigates the conditions that influence the government's ability to obtain intelligence in counterinsurgencies. Specifically, it suggests that the government is more likely to use indiscriminate violence in areas characterized by indigenous ethnic homogeneity and forested terrain. These features increase the cost of acquiring information about the insurgents, and reduce state capacity, thereby increasing the likelihood of indiscriminate violence. Method: We examine district-level data on the Russian government's use of indiscriminate violence and disaggregated data on ethnicity and terrain across the North Caucasus from 2000 to 2011. Results: The results indicate that ethnically homogeneous and forested areas are significantly more likely targets of indiscriminate violence, and that the effect of ethnicity is markedly stronger when the district is densely forested. Conclusion: This finding expands on previous studies by testing the observable implications of theories linking information to indiscriminate violence, and by providing new micro-level evidence for important human and physical constraints on counterinsurgencies.},
